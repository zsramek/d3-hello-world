# d3-hello-world

A quick example to test some basic functions of [D3](https://d3js.org/).

`lib/` containts the d3.js source, which can be downloaded here: https://registry.npmjs.org/d3/-/d3-7.6.1.tgz

`scripts/` contains the JavaScript for using D3.

To test, open `index.html` in a web browser. In Firefox this should just work. In Chrome, it is necessary to install a [web server extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb).
